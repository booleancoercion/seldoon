# seldoon
A thing that generates cool math videos.

Okay, to be more precise, `seldoon` can generate videos using procedurally generated frames,
where frames can come from an unlimited variety of formulas. My main goal was to visualize vector field flow,
but really any parametric equation could work with the code, and even non-parametric constructs that change over time.
